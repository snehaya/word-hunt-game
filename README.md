# word-hunt-game
I am very glad to share that I have created a word hunt game using html, css and javascript. 
Basically this game is all about typing, In this game words are coming from the top and user have to type those words in given time period
In this game their are three levels : 1. survival  2.Easy  3.Normal     
very first level is survival, in this level words are coming from the top user have to type same word in given input field, if word coming from top and user input matches then original word is replaced by new word and you will get one point and extra one second. time period for survival is one second.
second level is easy in this level same method is their, but user having three minutes of time and if word coming from top and user input matches then you will get one point.
third level is normal in that you have one minute
